# Next Steps: Premium Visual Overhaul

**User Feedback:** "The page feels like shit."
**Goal:** Drastically improve the look and feel to be premium, polished, and "wow" the user.

## Planned Improvements for Tomorrow

### 1. Typography & Typography Hierarchy
- Move away from standard weights. Use much bolder headings and lighter body text for contrast.
- Increase line-heights and letter-spacing for a cleaner, "editorial" look.
- Consider a massive, modern display font for the Hero section.

### 2. Color Palette Refinement
- The indigo/pink gradient might feel generic.
- PROPOSAL: Switch to a "Midnight & Neon" theme or a "Clean Swiss Style" (Monochrome + 1 Accent).
- Add subtle background patterns (mesh gradients, noise textures) to remove the "flat" feeling.

### 3. Layout Breakers
- The current layout is very "stacked" (Section -> Container -> Grid).
- We need overlapping elements, asymmetry, and "broken grid" layouts to make it dynamic.
- The "Floating Glass Navbar" was a start, but the rest of the page needs to match that quality.

### 4. Advanced Animations
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects.
- Magnetic buttons (buttons that stick to the cursor slightly).
- Text reveal animations (lines splitting up).

### 5. Section Specifics
- **Hero:** Needs a 3D element or a very high-quality interactive canvas background, not just a blob.
- **Projects:** changing from simple cards to large, immersive case study previews.
- **Micro-interactions:** Hover states need to be more than just "transform: translateY". They need glow, border-draw, or color shifts.
